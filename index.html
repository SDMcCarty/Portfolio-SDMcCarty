            <p class="about-me about-me-p">When I realized I couldn’t be a tiger when I grew up, 
                I thought about what I wanted to do with my decidedly 
                human life and found I love helping. In high school, 
                I was introduced to coding, and decided to pursue it in 
                university. Being young and dumb, I listened when someone 
                close to me said I’d be too stupid to do it. I graduated with 
                degrees in Advertising and Japanese, then moved to Japan to 
                teach English in a public school. I was in Sendai when the 
                earthquake/tsunami/near-nuclear-disaster happened, and worked 
                tirelessly with fellow staff to run the emergency evacuation 
                site. That experience rekindled my desire to help. After 
                returning, I was lost until I remembered - coding! Computers 
                help people in multiple ways and I wanted in on that helping 
                action. I started my coding journey with Thinkful, and am super 
                excited to see where I’ll go on this crazy journey.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me about-me-p">Outside of coding, I enjoy art, writing, video games, and cooking. 
                I am a published artist, and (soon-to-be) published author, and have 
                an undeniable love of spices that has culminated in a spice-off with 
                my roommate’s brother. I still hold the crown, and now go by Spice 
                Queen in one part of the world.

            <h2 class="about-me about-me-h2">About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-me about-me-p">When my childhood dream of being a tiger was 
                dashed, I contemplated my decidedly human life and discovered  
                <span class="emphasis">I love helping</span>. Upon graduating from 
                university, I moved to Sendai, Japan to teach in a public school. 
                After the earthquake/tsunami/near-nuclear-disaster, we teachers ran the 
                evacuation site. That experience 
                <span class="emphasis">rekindled my desire to help</span>. Computers 
                help in countless ways. I wanted in on that helping action, 
                and began my coding journey.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me about-me-p">When not coding, I enjoy art, writing, 
                video games, and cooking. I am a published artist and author, and 
                the undisputed Spice Queen amongst my friends.

            <h2><a href="https://sdmccarty.github.io/quiz-app-Andy-Sherry/" class="header-link">Animal Group Quiz App</a></h2>
            <p class="programs"><i class="fab fa-js-square"></i></p>
            <p class="project-p">This REACT-ful JavaScript app was created to
                test animal lover's knowledge of what certain animal groups
                are called. Every since learning what a group of bunnies is called, 
                I've been very interested in learning about other animal groups. 
                Some are very apropos (the rhino, which is in the test, so no spoilers!), 
                and some are slightly outlandish (a group of giraffes is called a tower!), most animal 
                group names are interesting to learn about. From start to finish, users select 
                their answer, are given the correct one, and finally shown their final score 
                before being asked if they'd like to try it again. Give it a try - hopefully we'll 
                kindle (a group of kittens) your interest!

            <p class="programs"><i class="fab fa-js-square"></i> <i class="fab fa-react"></i></p>
            <p class="project-p">This is a placeholder for until I have another app to 
                put up. Or, perhaps I made another quiz app that is spookily similar to the first. The
                world definitely knows which it is though. This project is yet to be created, but I hope 
                it was created from a sense of wonder about the world, and made for those who will wonder 
                with me.

            <p class="programs"><i class="fab fa-js-square"></i> <i class="fab fa-react"></i> <i class="fab fa-node-js"></i></p>
            <p class="project-p">I just really love penguins and made another 
                app featuring them. Have I fooled you? This app is definitely a placeholder. Bamboozled! 
                Once this app is made, more details will be put in. However,at this time, it's mostly here 
                to make sure my layout is working at least somewhat decently. I hope no one was actually 
                bamboozled in the making of this placeholder.

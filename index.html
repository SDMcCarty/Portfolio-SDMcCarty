            <h2 class="about-me about-me-h2">About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-me about-me-p">When my childhood dream of being a tiger was 
                dashed, I contemplated my decidedly human life and discovered  
                <span class="emphasis">I love helping</span>. Upon graduating from 
                university, I moved to Sendai, Japan to teach in a public school. 
                After the earthquake/tsunami/near-nuclear-disaster, we teachers ran the 
                evacuation site. That experience 
                <span class="emphasis">rekindled my desire to help</span>. Computers 
                help in countless ways. I wanted in on that helping action, 
                and began my coding journey.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me about-me-p">When not coding, I enjoy art, writing, 
                video games, and cooking. I am a published artist and author, and 
                the undisputed Spice Queen amongst my friends.

            <h2><a href="https://sdmccarty.github.io/quiz-app-Andy-Sherry/" class="header-link">Animal Group Quiz App</a></h2>
            <p class="project-p">This REACT-ful JavaScript app was created to test animal lover's knowledge of what certain animal groups are called. Every since learning what a group of bunnies is called,  I've been very interested in learning about other animal groups. Some are very apropos (the rhino, which is in the test, so no spoilers!),  and some are slightly outlandish (a group of giraffes is called a tower!), most animal group names are interesting to learn about. From start to finish, you can select your answer, get the correct one, and finally you can see your final score before being asked if you'd like to try again. Give it a try - hopefully we'll kindle (a group of kittens) your interest!

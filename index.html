            <h2 class="about-me about-me-h2">About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-me about-me-p">When I realized I couldn’t be a tiger when I grew up, 
                I thought about what I wanted to do with my decidedly 
                human life and discovered I love helping. In high school, 
                I was introduced to coding, and decided to pursue it in 
                university. Being young and dumb, I listened when someone 
                close to me said I’d be too stupid to do it. I graduated with 
                Advertising and Japanese degrees, then moved to Japan to 
                teach English in a public school. I was in Sendai when the 
                earthquake/tsunami/near-nuclear-disaster happened, and worked 
                tirelessly with fellow staff to run the emergency evacuation 
                site. That experience rekindled my desire to help. After 
                returning, I was lost until I remembered coding! Computers 
                help people in multiple ways and I wanted in on that helping 
                action. I started my coding journey with Thinkful, and am super 
                excited to see where I’ll go on this crazy journey.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me about-me-p">Outside of coding, I enjoy art, writing, video games, and cooking. 
                I am a published artist, and (soon-to-be) published author, and have 
                an undeniable love of spices that has culminated in a spice-off with 
                my roommate’s brother. I still hold the crown, and now go by Spice 
                Queen in one part of the world.

                users on their knowledge of what certain animal groups

                one, and finally told their final score and asked if they'd
